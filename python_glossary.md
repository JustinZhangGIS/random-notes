### 布尔运算符

Best practice: always use parentheses (()) to group your expressions to ensure they're evaluated in the order you want. Remember: explicit is better than implicit!

there is an order of precedence or order of operations for boolean operators. The order is as follows:

1. not is evaluated first;
1. and is evaluated next;
1. or is evaluated last.
